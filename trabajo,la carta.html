    <h3>Re:Eileen Dover university application</h3>
   
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
   
    <p>Thank you for recent application to join us at the University of Awesome`s science faculty to study as part
    of your <ins>PhD</ins> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the followeing sections.</p>
    
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    
    <p>We are happy to accomodate your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
    could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
   
    <ul>
        <li>First semester:9 September 2016</li>

        <li>Therd somester:2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which stard date you would prefer.</p>
    
    <p>You can find more information about <ins>important university dates</ins> on our website</p>
    
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty. We have a pretty openÂ·minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an inteligent, dedicated research, and just
    the kind of person we`d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
    <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
   
    <ol>
        
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Mwasuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayers at tempratures excceding 30&#8451(86&#8457),when the
        audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>>3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        
    </ol>
    
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you`d expect the
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we`d need to know?Thans.</p>
    
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes,you are right!As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances.Toanswer your question
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
   
    <p>Polynesian chiken dance</p>
    <dl>
        <dd>Alittle know but <em>very</em>influential dance dating back as far as 300<ins>BC</ins>, a whole village woulde dance around</dd>
        <dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be"fruitful".</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <dl>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
        <dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably</dd>
        <dd>tiny, very repid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</dd>
        <dd>modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <dl>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub> believed to have</dd>
        <dd>discovered a new dance style characterised by"robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
        <dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
        <dd>because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>
   
    <p>For more of my research, se my <ins>exotic dance research page</ins>.</p>
    
    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
